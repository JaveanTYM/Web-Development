        Do you even need a recipe to find something to do with an egg? No, not really, but why limit yourself?<br><br> With these egg recipes, you’ve got eggs prepared every way you can possibly imagine. That means baked with coconut milk and cilantro! Fried on top of fried black rice! Poached with shrimp and grits! Swirled raw into a creamy carbonara! Scrambled with tons of greens (and whatever else you find in the fridge) for a frittata. Steamed and topped with chile oil and herbs. And of course, perfectly jammy. <br><br>Shockingly, Americans once ate twice as many eggs as they do today. With this many good egg recipes to keep us craving, we’re ready to eat up.</p>

        <h4>Servings: 4 to 6 servings</h4>
        <p>The Vietnamese take on this treat makes for a dessert coffee,<br> a silky concoction comprised of a sweet eggy foam floating atop<br> of a cup of dark brew. Imagine a tiramisu in beverage form, and<br> you will likely get pretty close to the vibe of a good egg coffee.<br> Just a few minutes of work might make you a believer in egg<br> coffee as its delicious flavor and texture might make your morning<br> coffee look in need of that oomph.</p>

                    <p>For the Foam:
                      <ul>
                      <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
                      <li>1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk</li>
                      <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
                    </ul>
                      For the Coffee:
                      <ul>
                      <li>2 ounces (60 grams) French roast coffee, finely ground</li>
                      <li>4 1/8 cups hot water</li>
                      <li>Cocoa powder, optional</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Steps to Making It:</h3>
                    <p>Make the Eggy Foam:
                      <ol>
                      <li>Gather the Ingredients</li>
                      <li>Combine the egg yolks, condensed milk, and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer. Beat with the wire whisker on high for about 10 minutes.
                        The appearance should be similar to a cake batter, not especially frothy.</li>
                      <li>To test for the right consistency, spoon a small amount of the foam on top of a glass of water. If it floats it has the right consistency. If not, whip it for a few more minutes.</li>
                    </ol>
                      Assemble the Egg Coffee:
                      <ol>
                      <li>Brew the coffee according to your preferred method. Reserve about half a cup for later use.</li>
                      <li>Divide the remaining brewed coffee among 4 to 6 cups. If desired, set each cup in a small bowl of hot water to prolong the warmth of the coffee.</li>
                      <li>Gently spoon some of the whipped egg foam onto the top of each coffee, 1 to 2 tablespoons per cup.</li>
                      <li>Pour a bit of the reserved coffee through the foam in each cup. Dust with cocoa powder if desired. Serve immediately.</li>
                    </ol>

           <li>Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat.</li>
           <li> Working in batches, cook bread until golden brown on one side, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn and immediately crack an egg into the hole of each slice; season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to medium-low and partially cover pan. Cook until eggs are set, about 3 to 4 minutes. </li>
           <li>Repeat with remaining bread and eggs. Cook bread rounds until golden, about 1 to 2 minutes per side.</li>
           <li>Serve with hot sauce, if desired.</li>

                  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
              <p>
                <ul>
                <li>1 c. heavy cream</li>
                <li>1 (1-inch) piece ginger, sliced</li>
                <li>2 tsp. pure vanilla extract</li>
                <li>8 whole cloves, crushed</li>
                <li>6 allspice berries, crushed</li>
                <li>2 cinnamon sticks, broken</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp. freshly grated nutmeg, plus more for serving</li>
                <li>4 c. whole milk, divided</li>
                <li>8 large eggs, separated</li>
                <li>3/4 c. granulated sugar</li>
                <li>Pinch kosher salt</li>
                <li>3/4 c. to 1 c. dark rum, cognac, bourbon, or a combination</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <h3>Steps to Making It:</h3>
              <p>
                <ol>
                <li>Combine heavy cream, ginger, vanilla, cloves, allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, and 2 cups milk in a medium saucepan. Cook over medium heat until tiny bubbles begin to appear around the edge of the pot (do not let boil), 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and let steep 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, beat egg yolks with an electric mixer on medium speed until combined. Gradually beat in sugar and salt. Increase mixer speed to high and beat until thick and very pale in color, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Strain spiced cream mixture, discarding spices; return to pot. Slowly whisk 1 cup warm cream mixture into yolk-sugar mixture on low speed; return to pot with cream mixture. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula, until mixture reaches 170°F and coats the spatula, 12 to 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Place the pot over a large bowl filled with ice water and let cool, stirring occasionally, until chilled, 20 to 30 minutes. Stir in rum, cognac, or bourbon and remaining 2 cups milk.</li>
                <li>Just before serving, beat egg whites with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until soft peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes; fold into eggnog. Serve topped with nutmeg.</li>

                    <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 450° and grease a large baking sheet with cooking spray. Separate egg whites and yolks, placing egg whites in a large bowl and yolks in a small bowl. Using a whisk or hand mixer, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form, 3 minutes. Gently fold in Parmesan and ham and season with salt and pepper.</li>
                    <li>Spoon 8 mounds of egg whites onto prepared baking sheet and indent centers to form nests. Bake until lightly golden, about 3 minutes. </li>
                    <li>Carefully spoon an egg yolk into center of each nest and season with salt and pepper. Bake until yolks are just set, about 3 minutes more. </li>
                    <li>Garnish with chives before serving.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <h3>TIP:</h3><h4>Our favorite way to SEPARATE EGGS is by simply cracking the egg and separating the yolk back and forth, but you can also use the water bottle hack: Crack an egg into a bowl and use an empty plastic bottle to suction the yolk inside. (It’s kinda crazy how well it works.)</h4>

                              <ol>
                              <li>Preheat oven to 350°. Mix cranberry sauce, mustard, and red pepper flakes in a small bowl. Spread relish over 1 side of each slice of bread.</li>
                              <li>Melt 1 Tbsp. butter in a medium ovenproof nonstick skillet over medium heat. Place 1 slice of bread, plain side down, in skillet and cook until just golden on bottom side, about 2 minutes.</li>
                              <li>Scatter ¾ cup cheese over and slightly around bread (the cheese in contact with the pan will begin to melt immediately). Transfer skillet to oven and bake until cheese is golden brown around edges, about 2 minutes. Remove skillet from oven and top bread with a few slices of ham; let sandwich cool slightly in pan 1 minute. Using a rubber spatula, carefully loosen edges of cheese and transfer sandwich to a plate. Repeat with remaining butter, bread, cheese, and ham to make 3 more sandwiches. Wipe out skillet.</li>
                              <li>Heat oil in same skillet over medium. Crack eggs into skillet, cover, and cook until whites are just set but yolks are still runny, about 3 minutes. Top each sandwich with a fried egg; season with salt and pepper.</li>

                                      <li>Put the chocolate, butter and 75ml warm water (see tip, below) in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water. Push the chocolate and butter gently into the warm water with a wooden spoon to help it melt, but avoid stirring too much. Once three-quarters of the butter and chocolate is melted, remove the bowl from the heat. Stir until melted, smooth and glossy. Set aside until lukewarm.</li>
                                      <li>Working quickly, use a spatula to stir the egg yolks into the chocolate mixture, one at a time. In a separate bowl, use an electric whisk to whip the egg whites to soft peaks, then gradually add the sugar, whisking, until stiff peaks form.</li>
                                      <li>Gently fold about a fifth of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture, then fold in the rest, being careful not to knock out the air bubbles. Pour into wine or dessert glasses, cover with clingfilm and chill overnight to set.</li>
                                      <li>When ready to serve, whip the cream (if using) to soft peaks. Top each glass with a spoonful of cream and decorate with chocolate shards, if you like.</li>

                                      <li>1/2 tsp. salt</li>
                                      <li>1/2 tsp. freshly ground pepper</li>
                                      <li>5 large egg yolks, beaten; plus 7 large egg whites</li>
                                      <li>2 c. grated Havarti cheese (about 8 ounces)</li>
                                      <li>2 large scallions, thinly sliced (about 2/3 cup)</li>

                                  <h3>Steps to Making It:</h3>
                                  <p>
                                    <ol>
                                    <li>Roast pepper directly under broiler or over an open flame, turning it frequently, until blistered and blackened on all sides, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer pepper to a large bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and let sit for 20 minutes to steam. When cool enough to handle, remove plastic wrap and use a paring knife to peel off skin. Slit pepper down one side; remove stem and seeds. Finely chop pepper and set aside.</li>
                                    <li>Preheat oven to 375°F, with a rack in the lower third of the oven. Coat an 8-cup (2-quart) soufflé dish or casserole, at least 4 inches deep, with 1 tablespoon butter. Dust with breadcrumbs; shake out any excess. Set aside. In a medium pot over medium-high heat, bring milk, garlic, and bay leaf to a simmer. Reduce heat to low. In another medium pot over medium heat, melt remaining butter. Whisk in flour and cook for 3 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove garlic and bay leaf from milk mixture; then, while continuously whisking, add the milk to the butter-flour mixture in a slow, steady stream. Cook until mixture thickens and begins to boil, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and add salt and pepper; stir.</li>
                                    <li>In a medium bowl, temper egg yolks by whisking in a cup of the milk-flour mixture in a slow, steady stream. Continuing to whisk, transfer tempered yolks in a slow, steady stream to remaining milk-flour mixture. Stir in cheese until melted, and transfer mixture to a large bowl. Stir in scallions, dill, and reserved red pepper.</li>
                                    <li>In a medium bowl, using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat egg whites to stiff but not dry peaks. Using a spatula, stir one-third of the egg whites into the cheese mixture, then fold in remaining whites. Pour into prepared dish. Bake until soufflé is golden brown and has risen about 3 inches, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. (Do not open oven door until soufflé has baked at least 30 minutes.) Garnish with dill, if desired. Serve immediately.</li>
                                  </ol>
                                  </p>

                                    <p>
                                      <ul>
                                      <li>Cream cheese – the main ingredient of this recipe. Use full fat cream cheese, with at least 30% fat (check nutritional label). </li>
                                        <li>Lemon juice – used to add a tangy flavour to the cheesecake. This can also be replaced with vanilla extract for a more subtle taste.</li>
                                        <li>Eggs – really important for helping the soufflé cheesecake rise. I recommend using large eggs, free-range or organic. For a more stable meringue, use chilled eggs. </li>
                                        <li>Cake flour – is essential to yield an extra soft cake. As Japanese cheesecakes are so delicate, cake flour cannot be replaced with all purpose or self-rising flour. </li>
                                        <li>Sugar – used to add sweetness and help the meringue become more stable. This cake is not overly sweet, but the sugar can be adjusted slightly for a sweeter cheesecake. Alternatively, dust the cake with icing sugar. </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Steps to Making It:</h3>
                                    <p>
                                      <ol>
                                      <li>Combine the cream cheese, melted butter and hot milk in a large bowl. Whisk well until the mixture becomes like a creamy paste. If the cream cheese is too lumpy, heat gently over a double boiler. </li>
                                      <li>Mix in the egg yolks into the cream cheese mixture, then sieve in the flour. Combine everything with a whisk or spatula. Sieve the mixture again if there are any lumps of flour. </li>
                                      <li>Whip the egg whites and pour in the lemon juice once the mixture becomes frothy. </li>
                                      <li>Incorporate the sugar into the egg whites slowly, in thirds. Continue mixing until the meringue reaches soft-medium peaks. </li>
                                      <li>Fold in one third of the meringue into the cake batter. Add in the remaining meringue without deflating too much air, using a spatula. To combine, use a sweeping motion to fold the batter in on itself. It’s important to not deflate too much air from the meringue. </li>
                                      <li>Pour the cake batter into the lined pan, then prepare to bake.</li>
                                      <li>The outside of the springform pan needs to be covered with aluminum foil to prevent water from seeping in. I recommend using two or three layers of foil. </li>
                                      <li> Place the cake pan into a deeper, larger pan. Pour boiling water into the larger pan, around 1-inch in height. </li>
                                      <li>Bake the cheesecake in a pre-heated oven for 30 minutes, then open the oven door for to release some steam. Releasing some steam prevents the cheesecake from becoming too soft.</li>
                                      <li>Reduce the oven temperature to and bake for an additional 30 minutes. As this cheesecake is so soft, the skewer test will not be as effective. The cheesecake will be ready when it has a slight wobble, but it’s golden-brown on top.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <h3>TIPS:</h3><h4>Do not add all the sugar at once. Pouring all the sugar in can deflate the meringue. Add the sugar in thirds every 30 seconds, whilst mixing</h4>

                                  <li>Whisk together granulated sugar and cornstarch in a bowl. Beat egg whites on medium-high speed with an electric mixer, until foamy, about 1 minute. Add cream of tartar and salt, beating until blended. Reduce mixer speed to medium and gradually add sugar mixture, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until mixture is glossy, stiff peaks form, and sugar dissolves,1 to 2 minutes. Beat in vanilla.</li>
                                  <li>Drizzle one-quarter of preserves in a zigzag pattern onto meringue. Scoop 2 portions of meringue mixture (about 1/3 cup each) onto prepared baking sheet. Make an indentation in center of each meringue to hold filling. Repeat procedure 3 more times.</li>
                                  <li>Bake until pale golden and outsides have formed a crust, 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes. Turn oven off; let meringues stand in oven, with door closed and light on, 12 hours</li>
                                  <li>Beat cream and confectioners’ sugar with an electric mixer on high speed until medium peaks form, about 1 minute. Fill meringues with whipped cream and Blueberry Sauce. Serve immediately.</li>
                                  <li>For the blueberry sauce, stir together sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a medium saucepan. Stir in fresh blueberries, water, and fresh lemon juice. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, and cook, stirring often, until a few blueberries pop, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in vanilla extract. Cool completely.</li>

                                    <li>butter for cooking</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Steps to Making It:</h3>
                                <p>
                                  <ol>
                                  <li>Preheat a pancake griddle to 350 degrees F. Prepare the butter by leaving it out at room temperature.</li>
                                  <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and buttermilk. Add flour, baking soda, salt, and sugar and mix just until combined.</li>
                                  <li>Grease your griddle with butter and pour in 1/2 cup of batter. When the batter hits the griddle, level it out with the back of a spoon or ice cream scoop.</li>
                                  <li>Once your batter starts to bubble and the edges are set, flip your pancake and cook for another two minutes.</li>
                                  <li>Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each pancake.Serve warm.</li>
                                </ol>
                                </p>
                                <h3>Tips:</h3>
                                <h4>1. Never overmix your batter! You want to mix the dry ingredients and wet ingredients separately before whisking them together in one bowl. Once they’re combined, your batter is ready.</h4>
                                <h4>2. Make sure your griddle is hot enough! For this recipe, you want it to be 350 degrees F.</h4>
